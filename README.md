# JetPet Buddies

Welcome to the [JetPet Buddies GitHub Team](https://github.com/JetPet-Buddies)! Our platform is AI-driven, tailored for the traveling parent-child duo, aimed at enriching their journey with educational and interactive experiences.

## Pain Points
- **Low-Quality Interaction**: The norm of modern parenting often leads to unhealthy interactions with children during travels.
